Task 30

We're sorry that we are to late with the feedback this time, we had plain communication problems, so just nobody sent our notes away.
Following you will find our thoughts while seeing the video. :-)

music a little too loud
good visual structure
before 3:50 there is a pause, where the *music stops* at a seemingly random time during explaining. 
very nice visualuzung of all the formulae and
clever way of viz umformungen

what was the highlevel idea again?? / Why do you need it and for what? (Cannot be mentioned often enough.)

 Hoping you have a wonderful time. greetings from group 33.
