Bias in Neuroinformatics


Prolog:
    Assumptions/Motivation: (not saying that it's our task Ã¤hm)
    - Biases are in every computer program algorithm, it is surrounding us all the time and this is why its important to discuss.
    
    
What is the Bias? 

    - In real life we estimate a lot, the footpath to goal, relations and computations. 
       - In neuroinformatics it's the same. --> In all of the problems we can find an estimator.
    - So the bias is: the Difference between the real value and our estimation (which we made up) is the bias.
    
    - The Dart example:
                  - Applied on the example we might think of throwing darts onto a dartboard. 
                  - We might estimate the distance to the bulls eye and how much force is needed to throw the arrow onto the target. And throw.
                  - Unluckerly we missed our goal and hit the dartboard a little bit to much on the right side.
                  - The calculated bias would be the difference from the position we threw and the actual goal - The bulls eye.

    - Can there be other types of biases?
                  - The proof that the sample variance is biased and needs the bessel's correction (but this don't answers the question fully?)
    
    
Give reasons for bias and discuss the behaviour of the bias for large number of data samples:
    
     - Another example The Population of crane (Kraniche) big beautiful birds:
                  - When we would larger the sample size from n=10,100,999 Population size = 1000
                  - The bias becomes more and more irrevelant, B(estimation)= estimation - real value
                  - The bias would conjugate to 0. 
                  
                  
Epilog:

    - How revelant is the information. 
    - May be we notice that by simplifying (sampling, using model) there could appear biases. But computations are more quickly.
