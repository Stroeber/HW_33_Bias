Bias in Neuroinformatics

Prolog: greeting
Intro:
    - bias in everyday life (& psychology ...) ( list of cog biases! -> scroll though!)
 - In real life we ***estimate*** a lot, the footpath to goal, relations and computations. 
       - In neuroinformatics it's the same. --> We use estimators in many problems.  
 - So the bias is to assess how good an estimator is:

What is a Bias?   
     the Difference between the real value and our estimation (which we made up) is the bias.
    
1  it also gives us a startung point of how to make our estimate better 
    
    - The Dart example:
                  - Applied on the example we might think of throwing darts onto a dartboard. 
                  (- We might estimate the distance to the bulls eye and how much force is needed to throw the arrow onto the target.) 
                  And throw a few times.
                  - Unluckerly we miss our goal and hit the dartboard a little bit to much on the right side every time.
                  - The calculated bias would be the difference from the position we threw and the actual goal - The bulls eye.

1   we incorrporate the knowledge of being drawn to one side to make it better


    - These are (two) examples of biases.
    
    
Give reasons for bias and discuss the behaviour of the bias for large number of data samples:
    
     - Another example The Population of crane (Kraniche) big beautiful birds:
                  - When we would larger the sample size from n=10,100,999 Population size = 1000
                  - The bias becomes more and more irrevelant / less and less pronounced. b(estimation)= estimation - real value
                  - The bias would conjugate to 0. (is that so? i just don't know)
                              
                  
Epilog: 

    - How revelant is the information. For what do we use this knowledge?
    - Maybe we notice that by simplifying / abstracting / estimate (sampling, using model) there could appear biases. 
    But computations are more quickly/ help us out when we don't have access to full knowledge,
    help us abstracting & comparing.
