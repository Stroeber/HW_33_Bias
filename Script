Bias in Neuroinformatics

Prolog: greeting


Intro:
What is a Bias?   

    - bias are everywhere! in our daily life (stereotypes, psychology, theories in science)          
            - ( list of cog biases! -> scroll though!)
            - In real life we ***estimate*** a lot, the footpath to goal, relations and computations. 
            - And for our human(man)-made computers it's the same.

    - But the main problem with biases comes also our best solution. Because they provide us a prediction for the future. (An Estimation)
            - In the end they doesn't always end up right. (sad emotion)
            
    - So speaking in therms of a neuroinformatical sense, we can find out whether our Estimations are close to the target or far away.
            - And this number can be calculated as a good value --> The bias.
                (1 it also gives us a startung point of how to make our estimate better) 
                
    
    - The Dart example/ found a more fitting on, Topfschlagen? (Wärmer, Wärmer, Kälter, Ganz kalt...):
                  - Applied on the example we might think of throwing darts onto a dartboard. 
                  (- We might estimate the distance to the bulls eye and how much force is needed to throw the arrow onto the target.) 
                  And throw a few times.
                  - Unluckerly we miss our goal and hit the dartboard a little bit to much on the right side every time.
                  - The calculated bias would be the difference from the position we threw and the actual goal - The bulls eye.

1   we incorporate the knowledge of being drawn to one side to make it better


Give reasons for bias and discuss the behaviour of the bias for large number of data samples?
    
     - Another example The Population:
                  - When we would larger the sample size from n=10,100,999 Population size = 1000
                  - The bias becomes more and more irrevelant / less and less pronounced. b(estimation)= estimation - real value
                  - The bias would conjugate to 0. (is that so? i just don't know)
                              
                  
Epilog: 
    
    - What can we do now after understanding what the bias means?
    - Maybe we can notice that the whole world suraround us is full of theories and system that need to predict things for the future.
    - That complex systems and tasks like the wether, earthquakes or analyze an election needs to be simplified (by sampling or using model) 
    - to be computable. help us out when we don't have access to full knowledge
    - And there will always comes with biases. (like Double Edged Blade)
